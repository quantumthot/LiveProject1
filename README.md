# LiveProject1

This is a code summary of a live group project I did while attending The Tech Academy, over a two week sprint.
I created a web-based UI application that utilizes various Python and Django features.  
In it, ther are databases to keep track of data, use of data scraping to collect and aggrigate data, and more!
You can save your favorite ski resort, and see the local temperature.
This project is built using Python, Django, SQLite, Bootstrap, Jquery, and HTML/CSS.
