# LiveProject1

This is a code summary of a live group project I worked on over a two week sprint, while attending The Tech Academy.<br>
I created a web-based UI application that utilizes various Python and Django features.<br>  
In it, there are databases to keep track of data, use of data scraping to collect and aggrigate data, and more!<br>
You can save your favorite ski resort, and see the local temperature.<br>
This project is built using Python, Django, SQLite, Bootstrap, Jquery, and HTML/CSS.<br>
